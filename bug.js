This React Native code uses the deprecated `componentWillMount` lifecycle method, which can cause unexpected behavior and errors in newer versions of React Native.  It's also missing error handling for the fetch request. 
```javascript
componentWillMount() {
  fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => this.setState({ data }));
}
```
