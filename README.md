# React Native Bug: Deprecated componentWillMount and Missing Fetch Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common bug in React Native applications: the use of the deprecated `componentWillMount` lifecycle method and the lack of proper error handling for `fetch` requests.  The `bug.js` file contains the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.

**Problem:**

* `componentWillMount` is deprecated and may be removed in future versions of React Native.  Using it can lead to unexpected behavior and errors.
* The `fetch` request lacks error handling. If the API request fails, the application will crash or display an unexpected error message.

**Solution:**

The `bugSolution.js` file shows how to correct these issues.  It replaces `componentWillMount` with `useEffect`, which provides a more robust and modern approach to managing lifecycle events and state updates. It also includes comprehensive error handling to gracefully manage network failures.
